# LUP-Decomposition
The basic principle used to write the LU decomposition algorithm and flowchart is – ““A square matrix [A] can be written as the product of a lower triangular matrix [L] and an 
upper triangular matrix [U], one of them being unit triangular, if all the principal minors of [A] are non-singular.”

So, for a linear system AX = b, the given matrix [A] can be decomposed into the product two lower and upper triangular matrices
